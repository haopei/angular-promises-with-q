Using Promises and $q in Angular
================================

This simple sample app demonstrates how promises are implemented in Angular.js, during async operations, using the `$q` service. The app simulates a delayed data fetch using the `setTimeout()` function, then uses the `$q.defer()` object to handle the asyncronous nature of the data retrieval.

## Running the App
Launch index.html and track the app's progress in the console.
